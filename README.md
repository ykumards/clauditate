> Mindful meditation app that integrates with Claude Code for automatic breathing breaks during development

Clauditate combines meditation with coding by automatically showing a beautiful breathing app whenever Claude Code is thinking or processing. Stay centered and mindful while Claude helps you code!

## Features

- **Automatic Integration**: Appears when Claude Code is thinking, disappears when done
- **Beautiful Breathing Guide**: Smooth visual animations for inhale/exhale cycles
- **Customizable Sessions**: Choose 5, 10, 20, or 30 breathing cycles
- **Progress Tracking**: Daily, weekly, and monthly meditation insights
- **Celebration**: Gentle confetti animation when sessions complete
- **Menubar App**: Unobtrusive presence in your system tray
- **Cross-platform**: Works on macOS, Windows, and Linux

## Installation

### npm (recommended)
```bash
npm install -g clauditate
clauditate --hook-claude  # Set up Claude Code integration
```

### Homebrew (macOS)
```bash
brew tap ykumards/tap
brew install clauditate
clauditate --hook-claude  # Set up Claude Code integration
```

### Manual Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ykumards/clauditate.git
cd clauditate
npm install
npm run build
npm link
clauditate --hook-claude
```

## Usage

### Automatic Mode (Recommended)
After running `clauditate --hook-claude`, the app will automatically:
- Show when Claude Code starts any tool operation
- Hide when Claude Code finishes
- Provide gentle breathing guidance during Claude's thinking time

### Manual Mode
```bash
clauditate --start      # Start the meditation app
clauditate --show       # Show the app
clauditate --hide       # Hide the app
clauditate --help       # Show all commands
```

### Managing Integration
```bash
clauditate --hook-claude    # Install Claude Code hooks
clauditate --unhook-claude  # Remove Claude Code hooks
clauditate --update-hooks   # Update hooks to latest version
```

## How It Works

Clauditate uses Claude Code's [hooks system](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks) to:

1. **PreToolUse Hook**: Triggers when Claude starts any tool (Bash, Edit, Read, etc.)
2. **PostToolUse Hook**: Triggers when Claude finishes a tool operation
3. **Stop Hook**: Triggers when Claude finishes responding

This creates natural meditation moments during development, helping you:
- Stay mindful during long Claude operations
- Take breathing breaks during complex tasks
- Maintain focus and reduce stress
- Practice mindfulness without disrupting workflow


## Configuration

Clauditate automatically configures Claude Code hooks in `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [{
      "matcher": "",
      "hooks": [{"type": "command", "command": "clauditate --show"}]
    }],
    "PostToolUse": [{
      "matcher": "",
      "hooks": [{"type": "command", "command": "clauditate --hide"}]
    }],
    "Stop": [{
      "matcher": "",
      "hooks": [{"type": "command", "command": "clauditate --hide"}]
    }]
  }
}
```

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ykumards/clauditate.git
cd clauditate
npm install
npm run build
npm run dev  # Start in development mode
```
